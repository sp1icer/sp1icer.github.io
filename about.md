<h1 class="about-me-h1">hi all!</h1>

welcome to my blog. i'm a young infosec professional who has a passion for destroying computers in all the best ways ;) i've been a red teamer/pentester for about 2 years now and i'm loving every second of it. for those who don't know me, my name is justin. my path to hacking was a weird one - i've been working on computers my whole life, but ignored that to pursue aerospace/mechanical engineering, then computer/electrical engineering in college. having figured out that i wasn't a fan of either of those career options, i turned back to doing helpdesk and networking.

<h1 class="about-me-h1">adhd and me</h1>

this doesn't come as a shock to those who know me, but i was recently let in on the fact that i've been working against adhd basically my whole life ðŸ™ƒ it's not too bad, but occasionally you'll see a flood of posts from me, then nothing - there's a good chance that adhd kicked in and i hyperfocused on something else for a bit. don't worry, i'll be back at some point ðŸ˜‘
