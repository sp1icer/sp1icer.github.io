## >> STREAM TECH DECK

Hi all, welcome back to your one-stop-shop for maybe fun, possibly worthless hacking knowledge! In today's episode of `weird stuff sp1icer's done`, we explore how I use my ~~tech deck~~ stream deck to automate things like virtual machine provisioning, setting up for HTB practicing, note taking, and more! Hopefully by the end of this post you should have enough knowledge to create your own commands and come up with creative automation solutions to your problems. Let's get started!

## >> WHAT IS A STREAM DECK, ANYWAYS?

Starting off with the easy stuff, a Stream Deck is Elgato's all-in-one broadcasting solution that is essentially a _very_ nice macro pad. Here's their paragraph on customizing the Stream Deck:

> Customizing Stream Deck is effortless. Simply drag and drop actions onto keys, and make them your own with custom icons. Need more actions? Turn keys into folders to amass and access as many actions as you want. Better yet, save unique key configurations as dedicated profiles for different games and apps, switch between them on the fly, and share them with fellow creators.

Okay, so that's pretty neat - per-app profiles and some neat integrations mean that we should be able to control OBS as streamers. It's _definitely_ marketed at the streaming crowd - [go check the site if you don't believe me](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck) - but we definitely are able to utilize this thing to perform [system actions](https://help.elgato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028234471-Elgato-Stream-Deck-System-Actions-Hotkey-File-Open-Weburl-Media-Controls-) to some simple degree. And as if _that_ weren't enough, they've [even provided an SDK](https://developer.elgato.com/documentation/stream-deck/sdk/overview/) that we can use to extend functionality (that's outside the scope of this post, though).
