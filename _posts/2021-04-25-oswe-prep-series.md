## >> INTRO

Hi all! It's been a while since I posted - I got really crazy trying to prep for my OSWE, which I promptly failed (hooray for OffSec exams!) and am currently re-preparing for. I figure since I've taken all of this time preparing and busting it studying, why not give a little back to everyone and outline what I've done thus far? My goal in this is not *entirely* altruistic - they say the best way to learn is to teach someone - but I'm hoping to help ease the journey for others! This post will share some of the resources that I've found useful, and serve as an intro to a series of posts where I outline different techniques and things I've learned. Let's hop in!
