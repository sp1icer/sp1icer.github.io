## >> HELLO, FRIEND.

This is going to be the...first. First post in a while, first post back, first post from me on mental health, lots of firsts going on here. I want to kind of ramble a bit about what happened to me in hopes that someone else doesn't do the same stupid things I seem to keep doing and hurting myself with. If I can save even one of you some future pain, then this post is worth it and has met its goals. Meanwhile, here's what we're trying to avoid:

But first, some background.

## >> WHOAMI

I'm sp1icer, hopefully that much was easy to grok. I'm a 28 year old eternal kid who has been obsessed with tech for as long as I can remember, and subsequently ignored that to go to college for other things. I also didn't have access to computers as much growing up so I feel...behind. It feels like I have this constant urge to binge watch something on Netflix, except in this case it's not Netflix, it's tearing apart tech concepts. I also have [ADHD](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/facts.html) which pairs extremely nicely with this (no, it's not a superpower) - and when I hyperfocus, _I hyperfocus_. I mean it when I say I've gone 18 hours at a time without eating to play with computers or attack things on HacktheBox. It's led to me rising in job titles/ranks extremely quick - I often tell people I've managed to get to my current job about 10 years too early. Sounds great, right?

....not quite. There's also this lovely little problem called [imposter syndrome](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/imposter-syndrome), you may have heard a bit about it going around as more and more people are starting to pay attention to it. The basic gist is that no matter what I do, I feel like I'm not good enough and don't deserve what I have. This doesn't _just_ extend to tech, but my entire life really - I go through plenty of bouts where I end up questioning whether my life is even worthwhile. Yes, it sucks - no, you don't have to worry (I have support systems in place should things get...worse. And they often do.). It kind of brings on this quote from Mr. Robot's Elliot:

>“Maybe wars aren’t meant to be won, maybe they’re meant to be continuous.”

I know that wasn't the intention of the original quote as Elliot was talking about external people and things, but it's kind of how my life seems to be going. I go through a cycle of `happy for a bit -> question if I'm worthwhile -> question if I deserve my life -> crash -> happy` and rinse and repeat. In a way, it's cathartic getting this down onto the blog - it feels like I'm less alone, somehow. Anyways.

So back to the imposter syndrome - the basic gist of it is that ADHD + computer obsession + imposter syndrome = a perfect storm where no matter what I do, no matter what bugs I find, no matter what I've heard from co-workers/bosses/friends, I don't think that I deserve to be where I am. It's a constant struggle to keep my head above water in a swimming pool where someone is filling it with a fire hose aimed directly at my face.

How does that lead to the twitter crash-and-burn tweet, you ask? Let's start by examining my study habits. At the time of that crash, here's what I was subjecting myself to each day:

* My 40-hour-per-week job, so 8 hours per day of that
* Reading 10 pages of Web App Hacker's Handbook
* 1.5 - 2 hours of Japanese/kanji practice
* Reading 10 pages of Mobile App Hacker's Handbook
* 1 45-minute video from PentesterAcademy's CRTP course
* 30 minutes - 1 hour of work related to OSSU's FOSS CompSci degree

Writing it all down here, I'm in awe that I didn't crash _sooner_. Oh yeah, somewhere along the way I wanted to go take my second exam attempt at the OSWE _and_ try to do CVE hunting on open-source apps. I really don't know _what_ I was thinking, if we're being honest.

Queue pending crash-and-burn.

## >> ANNIHILATION IS THE ANSWER

I hit that point, posted the message on Twitter, and then ran for the hills. It wasn't pretty - I couldn't do so much as look at a computer in my off time. I hit what we call [burnout](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/burnout), the state where basically everything sucks even if you liked it before. I fought extremely hard to keep my work productivity good, but I otherwise didn't even touch computers (including video games for a while). Once I get into burnout there's basically only one solution - annihilation. 

You can also think of it as a reset - basically I have to hard reboot once I get that low. No studying, no games, no anything - I basically just become a shut-in and watch mindless things on TV. It's really, really, _really_ not healthy. However, recovering can be better _if and only if_ you manage to turn it into a set of positive habits outside of the old ones (but that's really, realy hard to do right). Falling back into the old ways has always been my go-to, my default; it's always been the easiest but most destructive choice I could make. Finally this time I decided enough is enough, time to fight back.

![Man throwing his hands around wildly.](/assets/images/wcgw/square_up.gif)

The question is, how? How do we fight burnout, how do we fight against imposter syndrome? I honestly am not entirely sure, but here's what I've been doing so far.

Imposter Syndrome:
* Focus on positive wins
* Mindfulness practice (meditation is especially helpful for me)
* Realize "true imposters" don't feel imposter syndrome
* Talk with others, including a therapist

Burnout:
* Sleep more, or alternatively get better sleep
* Exercise (this was a big one for me, I'm getting quite the dad bod sans the kids)
* Mindfulness practice (meditation, again, is awesome for this)
* Go outside some
* Relax the pressure on yourself (if you're like me and stack piles of work on yourself)
* Do creative things that aren't related to work

And that's really it. Ultimately it boils down to _actually_ taking some time to have you time; and no, before you ask, _you time doesn't count if it involves more tech!_

## >> ありがとうございます！

With this, dear reader, our peek into my psyche comes to a close. Thanks for sticking around while I ramble on and on about things I'm in no way qualified to talk about, but I'm hoping at least someone who's just starting out can see what I put myself through and take it as a warning. Don't be like me, reader - be healthy, have boundaries. Much love and happy hacking!
