Welcome back friends to the webapp show that never ends! Today we're going to dive into what the SQL language is, how it's typically used in web applications, and some _light_ exploration of SQL injection techniques. This is meant to be a crash course - I'm not diving in headlong into super deep techniques - but hopefully people at all levels will be able to grok my descriptions and have a good feel for what's going on under the hood by the end. Keep an eye out, at some point in the future I may do a series on building a web application that uses these technologies!
