my name is justin, aka sp1icer - nice to meet you! i'm a recent grad, recently obsessed with all things computer. breaking, creating, playing, it doesn't matter; as long as it has something to do with a computer, i'm all over it. some of my current (computer) hobbies include hackthebox, learning react and the mern stack, and vulnerability research (both bug bounty and exploit dev).

in case you're curious about life outside of computers i'm a gamer, husband, and cat dad. i generally have an intense passion for all kinds of music and that has led to my passion project of music production - maybe eventually i'll finish a track and post it publically.
